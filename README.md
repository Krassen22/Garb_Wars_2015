# Garbage Wars 2015
VMware competition for Elsys Students.

Description provided by VMware:

Once upon a time in the virtual world of Javatopia there was a Big-Cloud-City. The town lacked garbage collection and the memory of the city was constantly growing. 10 commercial waste collection companies were competing for the exclusive license to do the environmental services. The Big-Cloud-City consisted of 10 sectors and there were 10 garbage cars in it, every company had one car in each sector. The rules for garbage collections in the virtual world of Javatopia were unexpectedly similar to the rules for garbage collection in the Java Language we all know. Each sector contains some regular objects and some system object. System object cannot be collected. Every regular object can be collected only if there is no way to reach it by following the references from the system objects. 

As this is a war, your program has to collect more objects than other programs running at the same time. Beware, if you don't collect the objects correctly, you car will explode. While repairing it, you will lose valuable time. Meanwhile your competitors can collect all the garbage.
